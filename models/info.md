# Models

Here are the trained models on the applications we have seen so far.

These models were trained on [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com) due to the lack of hardware, if you are in the same position, I recommend you to checkout [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15GalqNuLLnypU7Q2-t41SKwB_V66oJKz).

If you want to re-train or try different architectures, I let you the data and models on the last link.
