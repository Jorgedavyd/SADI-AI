# Models

Here are the trained models on the applications we have seen so far.

These models were trained on [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com) due to my GPUless computer, if you are in the same position, I recommend you to checkout [this](), just so you can train your models quickly.

If you want to re-train or try different architectures, I let a modular free code space on training section.
